#
# "hdfs" - Normal straight up HDFS if you have local disk in your
#          cluster.  This option is primarily for benchmarking and
#          probably shouldn't be used in the general case.
#
#          Be careful running this in a cluster environment.  The next
#          time you execute your job, if a different set of nodes are
#          allocated to you, the HDFS data you wrote from a previous
#          job may not be there.  Specifying specific nodes to use in
#          your job submission (e.g. --nodelist in sbatch) may be a
#          way to alleviate this.
#
#          User must set HADOOP_HDFS_PATH below.

@MODE_HDFSOVERNETWORKFS@

# "rawnetworkfs" - Use Hadoop RawLocalFileSystem (i.e. file: scheme),
#           to use networked file system directly.  It could be a
#           Lustre mount or NFS mount.  Whatever you please.

# Path for HDFS when using local disk
#
# If you want to specify multiple paths (such as multiple drives),
# make them comma separated (e.g. /dir1,/dir2,/dir3).  The multiple
# paths will be used for local intermediate data and HDFS.  The first
# path will also store daemon data, such as namenode or jobtracker
# data.
#
export HADOOP_HDFS_PATH="SSDDIRPREFIX/hdfs"

# HDFS cleanup
#
# After your job has completed, if HADOOP_HDFS_PATH_CLEAR is set to
# yes, Magpie will do a rm -rf on HADOOP_HDFS_PATH.  This may be
# convenient for cleaning up your job after it has run.  This is
# particularly useful for HDFS, b/c on your next job run, you may not
# be able to get the nodes you want on your next run, leading to
# problems.
#
# export HADOOP_HDFS_PATH_CLEAR="yes"

@PATH_HDFSOVERLUSTRE@

@PATH_HDFSOVERNETWORKFS@

# Path for rawnetworkfs
#
# This path is used for creating local per-node paths.

# If you have a local SSD, performance may be better to store
# intermediate data on it rather than Lustre or some other networked
# filesystem.  If the below environment variable is specified, local
# intermediate data will be stored in the specified directory.
# Otherwise it will go to an appropriate directory in Lustre/networked
# FS.
#
# Be wary, local SSDs stores may have less space than HDDs or
# networked file systems.  It can be easy to run out of space.
#
# If you want to specify multiple paths (such as multiple drives),
# make them comma separated (e.g. /dir1,/dir2,/dir3).  The multiple
# paths will be used for local intermediate data.
#
# export HADOOP_LOCALSTORE="SSDDIRPREFIX/localstore/"

# Option to use unique locations per job to store hdfs data
#
# If this is set to yes the nodes will append the job id to the
# current HDFSOVERLUSTRE and HDFSOVERNETWORKFS path thus keeping the
# hdfs data isolated per job. This enables the same script to be
# executed multiple times (usually with different data) without the
# HDFSOVERXXX instances colliding with each other
#
# Be careful to cleanup the HDFSOVERXXX directories from time to time,
# as Magpie will not clear data from prior jobs.
#
# export HADOOP_PER_JOB_HDFS_PATH="yes"

# HDFS Block Size
#
# Commonly 134217728, 268435456, 536870912 (i.e. 128m, 256m, 512m)
#
# If not specified, defaults to 134217728
#
# export HADOOP_HDFS_BLOCKSIZE=134217728

# HDFS Replication
#
# HDFS commonly uses 3.  When doing HDFS over Lustre/NetworkFS, higher
# replication can also help with resilience if nodes fail.  You may
# wish to set this to < 3 to save space.
#
# If not specified, defaults to 3
#
# export HADOOP_HDFS_REPLICATION=3

# RawNetworkFS Block Size
#
# Commonly 33554432, 67108864, 134217728 (i.e. 32m, 64m, 128m)
#
# If not specified, defaults to 33554432
