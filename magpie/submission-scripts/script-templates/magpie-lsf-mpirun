# Node count.  Node count should include one node for the
# head/management/master node.  For example, if you want 8 compute
# nodes to process data, specify 9 nodes below.
#
# If including Zookeeper, include expected Zookeeper nodes.  For
# example, if you want 8 Hadoop compute nodes and 3 Zookeeper nodes,
# specify 12 nodes (1 master, 8 Hadoop, 3 Zookeeper) 
#
# Also take into account additional nodes needed for other services,
# for example HDFS federation.

#BSUB -n <my node count>
#BSUB -o "lsf-%J.out"

# Note defaults of MAGPIE_STARTUP_TIME & MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME, this
# timelimit should be a fair amount larger than them combined.
#BSUB -W <my time in hours:minutes>

# Job name.  This will be used in naming directories for the job.
#BSUB -J <my job name>

# Queue to launch job in 
#BSUB -q <my queue>

## LSF Values
# Generally speaking, don't touch these, just need to configure slurm

#BSUB -R "span[ptile=1]"
#BSUB -x

# Need to tell Magpie how you are submitting this job
